The goal of this project was to design and create a system to incentivize a reduction in energy consumption. Because we were limited to a single semester, we did more designing than creating, but we did do more development than on either Cuebert or TreasureHunter. Drawing on two major concepts from social influence theory, normative influence and social comparison, we designed a game that ties the availability of an in-game resource, energy "food" for an avatar Frankenstein, to the efficiency with which one uses their computer. Using a Dashboard widget, we were able to report to the server how much time was spent with the player's computer running but not being used.
