### [Whom to follow](https://github.com/Noleli/Whom-to-follow)

Is <a  href="http://twitter.com">Twitter.com</a>’s “Who to follow” link driving you nuts? Then you need my super-nerdy-stickler Safari extension to fix it!

<p>I designed the front page (“Line View”), wrote a ton of Javascript, and assembled and installed many of the GPS hardware packages in the busses.</p>
