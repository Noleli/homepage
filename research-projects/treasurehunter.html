<p>The theme for the 2009 CHI Student Design Competition was "local". We set out to design a system that would increase the consumption of used goods in a community rather than new goods, which tend to be imported from elsewhere.</p>

Additional research into the incentives of each of these personas demonstrated the feasibility of such a system.</p>
