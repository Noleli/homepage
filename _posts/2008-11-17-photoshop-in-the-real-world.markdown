My dad just emailed me this cool picture of [Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/family/) in the "real world".

It's interesting because it's cool, but from an HCI perspective it also drives home the importance of affordances: you don't just pick a tool, you actually grab it and use it; you don't just choose a color, you actually dip your brush in it.
