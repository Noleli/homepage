### A long time ago


In a signal processing course I took back in my Electrical Engineering days, we were given an [audio clip]({{site.baseurl}}/post-uploads/Kruschev.wav) of then-Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev's translator issuing the following phrase:



> But we too, as you know, don't kill flies with our nostrils.



[NPR's Talk of the Nation](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4525510) did a segment around that time on phrases that don't translate well, and I submitted the audio clip. It got read on the air a few days later.



### This past weekend


This past weekend I went skiing in northern Michigan with some friends from school. Among them was a winter-admit student who is just starting this semester.



### Today


I randomly decided to search for that old Khrushchev phrase to see if there was any more info about it out on the internet. Searching for the exact phrase in quotation marks returned only one result: a [tumblr page](http://fencebreak.tumblr.com/post/113924247/but-we-too-as-you-know-dont-kill-flies-with-our) on which someone had posted the quote.

It turns out that tumblr page belongs to the girl I met this weekend. This is not the first time such a thing has happened to me, but it's still crazy.
