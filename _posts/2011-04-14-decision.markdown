Over the past couple months, I've been agonizing over the most difficult decision it has ever been my pleasure to agonize over: which of several interesting, relevant, and fantastic Ph.D. programs that I was accepted to should I attend?

Well, thanks to an externally imposed deadline, I've made my decision. It wasn't easy (I had to "call in preoccupied" to work yesterday), butâ€¦whew.

This fall, I will begin studying in the [Technology and Social Behavior](http://tsb.northwestern.edu/) program at [Northwestern University](http://www.northwestern.edu/). This is a young but unique program that offers a combined Ph.D. in Communication and Computer Science, and I'm excited to be a part of it!
