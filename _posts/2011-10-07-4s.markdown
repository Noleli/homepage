Really torn. On the one hand, my phone seems to occasionally decide to drain its battery in ~2 hours. Otherwise, it’s fine. A little slow, maybe. But worth dropping $399 on a new phone? What with all the labor and material sourcing issues, it’s hard to justify. I’m even up in the middle of the night and could pre-order at the 0 hour. But I think my gadget lust is wearing off. It’s a weird feeling.
