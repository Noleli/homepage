After over a year of on-again, off-again looking, demoing, playing, and stalling, I think I have finally settled on a note/snippet manager: [Yojimbo](http://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/index.shtml), from [Bare Bones Software](http://www.barebones.com/).

When I first started thinking about a snippet manager, what came to my head was something that looked basically like [Mail](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/mail.html), except that instead of messages it would contain notes. They could all be tag-able, and you could create smart folders out of those tags. When I started looking around, the product that satisfied this "dream app" exactly was [Notae](http://www.codepoetry.net/products/notae), from [Code Poetry](http://www.codepoetry.net/). So why Yojimbo?

Yojimbo has several features that I really like, even though the program as a whole is not as elegant as Notae. I really like the quick-entry box that can be called up with a system-wide shortcut key, I really like that it has a separate noteÂ  type for passwords, and I really like that it supports syncing (not that I have any devices that need syncing to -- yet).

Notae's inability to sync across devices bothered me, but what worried me more was that the Code Poetry blog identified a major performance problem in Leopard back at the beginning of January that has yet to be addressed nearly three months later. I can't say I blame the developers for having day jobs, and I absolutely love the independent developer community out there for the Mac, but there is a little bit of comfort knowing that the Bare Bones folks are working on their products full time.

Another distinction that would explain why Yojimbo has note types for things like passwords, serial numbers, and bookmarks is that it is designed as a snippet manager, whereas I guess Notae is designed as a note manager. Since I'm looking more to manage my snippets than my notes, Yojimbo may be the better choice.

I'll see how the 30-day demo of Yojimbo goes, but so far I like it.
