So, they tell me "Mash-ups" are all the craze, which means, of course, that every imaginable kind of information _must_ be piled on top of a Google Map.

A very cool example of this is [The Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/)'s [Fundrace](http://fundrace.huffingtonpost.com/), which is a Google map of the United States with public political donation information on it. The points are color-coded by party or candidate, and the size of the dot corresponds to the amount given by that individual. That's right: individual. You can zoom all the way down to individual people or households. It's kinda creepy, I'm not gonna lie, but it is a good thing that campaign donations are all public information.
