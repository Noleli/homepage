So, there's a blog called [Stuff White People Like](http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.wordpress.com/). It's very funny, and dead on in so many ways. I like it. (Does that make me white?)

I think someone should make a Facebook application that compares a user's profile to the list of stuff from the blog, then determines how white that person is.

I haven't given a ton of thought to how that comparison would work (_n_ things in profile that white people like / _m_ items in profile x 100 = % white?), but I think it'd be amusing.
