On February 22, 2021, NASA landed the [Perseverance rover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseverance_(rover)) on Mars.
Encoded in the parachute used for landing was the [JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) motto and [Teddy Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt) quote, "Dare mighty things".
Despite being a secret before landing, [the internet quickly decoded](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297094/hidden-message-parachute-nasa-mars-perseverance-rover) the message.

I thought that was pretty cool, so decided to make a little site that lets you make your own parachute using the same encoding.
[Other people](https://github.com/tanyafish/parachute/blob/main/The%20Parachute%20Message.pdf) have explained the encoding better than I could, so without further adieu, here is [Encode Mighty Things](https://projects.noahliebman.net/encodemightythings/).
