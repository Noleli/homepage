Sorry it's been so long since I last posted. I blame the fact that I'm working now. How silly. Luckily, I have a backlog of things I want to write about, of which this is the first installment.

The May 23rd edition of the [NPR](http://www.npr.org/) show [On The Media](http://www.onthemedia.org/) (yes, they capitalize the 'the') was about the future of paper. (I actually heard it on the 25th of May on my [local station](http://michiganradio.org/).) It covered a variety of angles to the story, such as e-paper and on-demand publishing, but what I found most interesting was an interview with a fellow (and Shorenstein Fellow) by the name of William Powers. In his paper entitled _[Hamlet's Blackberry](http://www.hks.harvard.edu/presspol/research_publications/papers/discussion_papers/D39.pdf)_, he argues (among other things) that what makes paper so enduring as a medium despite decades-long predictions of its impending demise is the way we humans interact with it, and the information it transmits to us.



For example, when reading a long article, paper, essay, or book on a computer, information about how far through the work you must be obtained using the eyes and brain, by looking at a scroll bar or other indicator that tells you that you are on page 21 of 50. A reader of a book, in contrast, knows their progress by simply feeling how think each half of the book is. How often have you said to yourself, "Oh, I'm halfway through!" about an online article? There is a distinct cognitive difference, which makes for a different reading experience.

Another trait of paper is that it offers no distractions. I will admit that even as I write this post, I have not read in its entirety the essay on which I am commenting. This is because computers make it psychologically easier to skim. We want to find the singular piece of information we are looking for, then move on. Sustained reading on a computer screen is not something we have adapted to (Or is it that computers have not adapted to the conditions we find conducive to sustained reading?). I have read much of the essay, but I keep finding myself coming back to continue the post, look something up on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/), check the weather, etc. Paper, of course, would leave me with no option but to read what is at hand, which is a gift to those of us with disappointingly short attention spans.

Personally, I don't know where paper is headed. Even as I try to elimitate as much paper as possible from my life (I am among the 15% of people mentioned in Powers's essay who have opted not to receive paper bank statements), I find that I can get through a newspaper article much more easily if it is printed on paper. I also find that ideas flow more easily when I hand-write a personal letter, although perhaps the slower pace at which words can be written on paper allows for more advance thought, which leads to the perception of more contiuous writitng. Ultimately, I don't know.
