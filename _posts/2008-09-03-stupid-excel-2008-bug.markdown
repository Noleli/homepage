I just have to say that there's a totally stupid bug in Excel 2008's window handling: like any normal program, you can use Command+` to cycle through all open windows. What's weird is that Command+` also cycles through documents that have been minimized to the doc. Annoying, seeing as the main reason I minimize docs is so I can cycle through just some of the ones I have open.

While I'm at it, if you have a cell that, say, starts with bold text and is followed by normal text, if you auto-complete a new cell with that same text, it applies whatever the formatting of the first character is to the entire cell.

Who wrights this stuff? Oh yeah...Microsoft.
