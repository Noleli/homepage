A funny thing happened. When I first tried a mouse in Lion with reverse scrolling on the scroll wheel, I hated it. So I changed it. But within hours I found myself wanting to flip it the other way. Maybe because I'm focusing more on content on less on the scrollbar? (Although I turned on always showing the scrollbar, too, so I don't know.)
