I just sent this email to the U of M Student Financial Operations office. Does that me a jerk?


> Hello,
>
> Thanks for making it so easy to pay online. I do have a complaint, though.
>
> On the Make Payment page of the QuickPAY ASP system, there is a sentence that says:  
> "Note: This screen is for Student Account payments only - Not for Enrollment Deposit's!"
>
> Never mind the somewhat sporadic capitalization and the use of a hyphen where there should be an em dash (I'm something of a stickler) â€” the apostrophe in "Deposit's" should not be there.
>
> Thank you!  
> -Noah
