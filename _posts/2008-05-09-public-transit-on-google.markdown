I don't know how long [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com) has been able to give directions using public transportation, because I'm sure Detroit has been late to that party. Now that there are some places in my area that Google tells me I can get to by [bus](http://www.smartbus.org/smart/home) (the only form of public transportation we've got, not that I've ever used it), it's been really interesting to compare how long they estimate it would take to drive a route versus riding the bus.

With the perfect storm of [peak oil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_oil), [climate change](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming), and enriching some unsavory characters (i.e. funding both sides of a war), I would love to be able to take the bus. Here's why I don't:

<ul>
<li>From my house to the local college
<ul>
<li>Driving: 10 minutes</li>
<li>Bus: 55 minutes, including a 35-minute walk</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>From my house to my yoga studio
<ul>
<li>Driving: 6 minutes</li>
<li>Bus: 42 minutes, only 2 of which are on the bus</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>From my house to my dad's workplace
<ul>
<li>Driving: 17 minutes</li>
<li>Bus: 2 hours, 48 minutes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

Pretty pathetic.
