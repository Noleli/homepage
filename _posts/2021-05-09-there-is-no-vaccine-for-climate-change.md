As I sat waiting the requisite 15 minutes to make sure I didn't go into anaphylactic shock, I looked out over the arena and reflected on the historic nature of that moment.
A building designed for basketball, concerts, and large-scale events sat empty for nearly a year because gatherings were a threat to public health.
It had then been repurposed into a makeshift medical facility where vaccines were being administered on a mass scale.
There's something dark --- and decidedly not _normal_ --- about a space designed for fun being used as a medical facility.

I felt grateful for the incredible work of the many brilliant and hard-working people both before and during the pandemic who allowed us to reach that moment.
But fear of what this medical marvel might symbolize was also on my mind.
<!-- But there was something remarkable about that moment, too. -->
We had all been waiting for medicine to end the pandemic, any too many people had been ignoring epidemiology's "inconvenient" non-medical interventions like social distancing and mask wearing.
We had been passively waiting for science to save us with vaccines, and this time we got lucky: science delivered.
<!-- and thanks , -->

<!-- The work of these researchers is nothing short of heroic, but I am uncomfortable with the fact that -->
<!-- Americans, as a whole, were unwilling to take small non-medical steps that could help limit the spread of a potentially deadly virus.
On the extremes you had people refusing to mask or social distance, and in the middle you had people unwilling to spend the massive amount of government money that would have been necessary to allow businesses to safely close their doors.
Yes, masking and social distancing are inconvenient, but not as inconvenient as getting --- or spreading --- COVID.
Rather than inconvenience ourselves socially or fiscally, as a society we decided we would rather just wait for vaccines. -->

This [technological solutionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_fix), waiting for a technological savior instead of making sacrifices, is at play in climate change, too.
I am absolutely thrilled that mRNA vaccine technology was practically ready and waiting to be applied to SARS-CoV-2 in record time, but it scares me that it reinforces a solutionist attitude: "See? Science saved us from the pandemic, so it'll also save us from climate change!"

There is no vaccine for climate change.
<!-- I, too, would love to see nearly unlimited carbon-free energy, but that's very unlikely to happen, and I don't think we should be sitting around waiting for it. -->
We'll need science to get us out of this, yes, but also political will.
Political will to reign in corporations.
Political will to fund science that can get us even partway there.
Political will to do things that hurt in the short term before the status quo does even more damage to more people.
<!-- Even though we didn't listen to epidemiologists, I hope that on climate change we will listen to the scientists who are telling us that societal  -->
<!-- I hope that we can move away from our quest for a technological savior, and urge our leaders to listen  -->
<!-- May we heed the lessons from COVID: science guides us, but there's no silver bullet. -->
Had we heeded epidemiologists' advice on COVID, millions of lives around the world could have been saved.
Let's not make the same mistake with climate change, squandering the remaining time we have while waiting for a scientific miracle.
