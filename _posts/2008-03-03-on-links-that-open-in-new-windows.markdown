Often when a website links to an off-site page, the link is set to open in a new browser window. I don't like this! I can choose to open any link in a new tab or window _if I want to_, but I cannot choose to open a link that is set to open in a new window in the same window. Please, leave the choice in the hands of the user.

I have been as guilty of this as anybody, but henceforth I will no longer engage in this practice.
