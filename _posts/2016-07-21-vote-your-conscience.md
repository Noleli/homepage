title: Vote your conscience
---

What’s happening at the Republican National Convention doesn’t feel real, but it’s real. The self-aggrandizing nominee for president claimed, “I alone can fix it.” Later, chants of “Yes you will, yes you will.” This is not about policies; it’s fear and cult of personality.

Fascism is the following (copied and pasted from [here](http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/events/Characteristicsoffascism.html)):

- Glorification of the past (before the debasement of the nation); past seen as glorious, source of inspiration for the present.
- Exaltation of force, strength, violence: slogans, symbols, costumes, insignias, military. Promotes discipline, sacrifice, blind obedience to the leader.
- A reaction (defines itself through reaction to something else): against those that have debased the nation, those that disunite it, that cannot defend it against its enemies.
- In fascism, the enemies of the nation are old corrupt politicians, foreigners, especially Jews, communism (promoted by Jews).

And let’s not forget the calls of “America First”, which is a reference to the [political party of Nazi sympathizer Charles Lindburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_First_Committee#Issues).

By all means, vote your conscience. I just hope that your conscience tells you that, above all, this man and his party must be defeated.
