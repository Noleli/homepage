A couple weeks ago there was a post in a [New York Times blog](http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/12/costs-of-text-messaging-vs-space-transmissions/index.html) about the cost of text messaging that I would like to briefly recap here. A British space scientist, [Nigel Bannister](http://www2.le.ac.uk/ebulletin/news/press-releases/2000-2009/2008/05/nparticle.2008-05-12.4476906328), ran some quick numbers and concluded that


> "The maximum size for a text message is 160 characters, which takes 140 bytes because there are only 7 bits per character in the text messaging system, and we assume the average price for a text message is \[about 10 cents\]. There are 1,048,576 bytes in a megabyte, so that's 1 million/140 = 7490 text messages to transmit one megabyte. At 10 cents each, that's \[$734\] per MB - or about 4.4 times more expensive than the 'most pessimistic' estimate for Hubble Space Telescope transmission costs \[of $166 per megabyte\]."


So basically, consumers have allowed mobile phone companies to charge _literally_ astronomical rates to send a text message: we pay at least 4.4 times as much to send a text message than [NASA](http://www.nasa.gov/) does to download data from the [Hubble Space Telescope](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/main/index.html) (in cost per unit data, anyway). I can't believe we put up with that. Disgusting, I think.
