If two points (or posts) make a trend, interactive data visualizations of the Hebrew calendar are a thing I blog about now. In the long and storied tradition of [single](https://www.howmanypeopleareinspacerightnow.com/)-[use](http://isthereacubsgametoday.com/) [novelty](http://www.isitajewishholidaytoday.com/) [sites](https://istrumpstillpresident.com/), I've created [isyontefearlythisyear.com](https://isyontefearlythisyear.com) (and its evil twin, [isyonteflatethisyear.com](https://isyonteflatethisyear.com)). Now you can point to real data when the conversation inevitably comes up before every holiday.
