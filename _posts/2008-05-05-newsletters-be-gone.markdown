Email is for correspondence; RSS is for news. That's why I've been on a bit of an unsubscribe kick lately. Every time I get an email newsletter, I check to see if there's also a syndicated version. If there is, I unsubscribe and add the feed to [NetNewsWire](http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWire/default.aspx). What a difference! Now the emails that I get are (usually) actually relevant, and I can read through [Science @ NASA](http://science.nasa.gov/) and other such cool-people stuff at my leisure.

So remember, kids: email is for correspondence, syndication is for news.
