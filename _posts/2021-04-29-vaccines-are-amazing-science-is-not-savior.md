As I sat waiting the requisite 15 minutes to make sure the vaccine didn't send me into anaphylactic shock, I looked out over the arena and couldn't help reflecting on the historic nature of that moment.
An arena designed for basketball, concerts, and other large gatherings sat empty for nearly a year because large gatherings were a threat to public health.
It had then been repurposed into a makeshift medical facility where vaccines were being administered on a mass scale.
There's something dark --- and decidedly not _normal_ --- about a space designed for fun being used as a medical facility.

But there was something remarkable about that moment, too.
We had all been waiting for science to end the pandemic, not through epidemiology, disease modeling, and the non-medical interventions those tell us are important, but vaccines.
We had been waiting for vaccines, and thanks to the incredible work of many brilliant and hard-working people both before and during the pandemic, science delivered.

The work of these researchers is nothing short of heroic, but I am uncomfortable with the fact that Americans, as a whole, were unwilling to take small non-medical steps that could help limit the spread of a potentially deadly virus.
On the extremes you had people refusing to mask or social distance, and in the middle you had people unwilling to spend the massive amount of government money that would have been necessary to allow businesses to safely close their doors.
Yes, masking and social distancing are inconvenient, but not as inconvenient as getting --- or spreading --- COVID.
Rather than inconvenience ourselves socially or fiscally, as a society we decided we would rather just wait for vaccines.

This same pattern of [technological solutionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_fix), waiting for a technological savior, instead of making hard sacrifices is at play in climate change, too.
I am absolutely thrilled that mRNA vaccine technology was practically ready and waiting to be applied to SARS-CoV-2 in record time, but it scares me that it reinforces a solutionist attitude: "See? Science saved us from the pandemic, so it'll also save us from climate change!"

I, too, would love to see nearly unlimited carbon-free energy, but that's very unlikely to happen, and I don't think we should be sitting around waiting for it.
We'll need science to get us out of this, yes, but also political will.
Political will to reign in corporations.
Political will to fund science that can get us even part way there.
Political will to do things that hurt in the short term before the status quo does even more damage to more people.
I'm not sure we have that.
