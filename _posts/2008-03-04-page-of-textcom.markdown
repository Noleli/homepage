I just came across an interesting take on collaborative editing: [page of text . com](http://pageoftext.com/). Barebones simple, it's for groups who don't need a full-fledged [Google Doc](http://docs.google.com/) or [Wiki](http://www.mediawiki.org/). No registration required: just go and start a "page of text". I kinda like the idea (not that I have a use for it at the moment).

I also think it's a bit odd that they like to put spaces in their URI when not using in a technical sense, but whatever.

Update: apparently once created, a page cannot be manually deleted, which I find rather unpleasant. My guess is that if a certain amount of time passes without being viewed or edited, it will get cleaned out, but I really don't like that a user has no way of removing a page.
