Several friends-who-are-girls of mine have recently starting talking on Twitter about listing (the closest one can get to "friending") each other on the online dating site [OkCupid](http://okcupid.com). This struck me as odd, especially as a guy, but a bit of further consideration has led me to this hypothesis:

As close ties have become weaker and fewer[^putnam] [^2] and the concept of friendship more explicitly and publicly articulated[^3], I can't help but wonder if opportunities for "girl talk" have become fewer. Girls listing their real-life girlfriends on OkCupid provides a way to articulate those ties and provide a social object[^4] (the profile) around which to engage in conversation about boys and dating in general.

As not-a-girl, I can't speak first hand to any of this, so comments/discussion are welcome.
