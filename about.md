Hi, I'm Noah.

![Me]({{site.baseurl}}/images/me_fordshoot.png){: .alignright}I am a design technologist at [Shure](https://www.shure.com), where I design and prototype software for managing microphones.
I recived a Ph.D. from [Northwestern University](http://www.northwestern.edu)’s unique [Technology and Social Behavior](http://tsb.northwestern.edu/) program, a joint Ph.D. in [Computer Science](http://eecs.northwestern.edu/) and [Communication Studies](http://www.communication.northwestern.edu/) where I worked with the [CollabLab](http://collablab.northwestern.edu/) and [Interactive Audio Lab](http://music.cs.northwestern.edu/).

My dissertation was on user interfaces for audio production, applying computational models of human auditory perception to the creation of smarter visualizations for professional multitrack mixing engineers. Previously, I worked on behavior in computer-mediated communication environments, studying the similarity between people's words in text-based communication.

While my work is on audio, I also take interest in (read: [tweet about](https://twitter.com/Noleli)) the effects of new technologies --- networked/&#8203;ubiquitous/&#8203;pervasive/&#8203;public/&#8203;personal/&#8203;mobile --- on society, including behavioral, privacy, business, and regulatory implications.

I have a Master’s in [HCI](https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/master-science-information/areas-interest/ux-research-and-design) from the [University of Michigan](http://www.umich.edu/) [School of Information](http://www.si.umich.edu/). My undergraduate work was in <a title="U of M EECS" href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/">electrical engineering</a> (signal processing and communications systems), also at the University of Michigan. My work now is the culmination of growing up in my dad's recording studio, then studying electrical engineering and HCI.

When not doing a science, I’ve been known to nerd out about music, tech, Judaism, design, theater, severe weather, space, punctuation, and bad puns. I play sax and guitar in a [garage band](https://www.facebook.com/ColdHandsChicago), practice yoga less frequently than I should, enjoy doing live audio, and can usually be seen interacting with one or more Apple products.
