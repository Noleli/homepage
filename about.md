Hi, I'm Noah.

![Me]({{site.baseurl}}/images/me_fordshoot.png){: .alignright}I’m a fifth-year Ph.D. student in [Northwestern University](http://www.northwestern.edu)’s unique [Technology and Social Behavior](http://tsb.northwestern.edu/) program, a joint Ph.D. in [Computer Science](http://eecs.northwestern.edu/) and [Communication Studies](http://www.communication.northwestern.edu/). I am a member of the [CollabLab](http://collablab.northwestern.edu/), and work with the [Interactive Audio Lab](http://music.cs.northwestern.edu/), as well.

My dissertation is on user interfaces for audio production, applying computational models of human auditory perception to the creation of smarter visualizations for professional multitrack mixing engineers. I am also interested in behavior in text-based computer-mediated communication, studying the similarity between people's words in text-based communication.

While my work is on audio, I also take interest in the effects of new technologies --- networked/&#8203;ubiquitous/&#8203;pervasive/&#8203;public/&#8203;personal/&#8203;mobile --- on society, including behavioral, privacy, business, and regulatory implications.

I have a Master’s in [HCI](http://www.si.umich.edu/academics/msi/human-computer-interaction-hci) from the [University of Michigan](http://www.umich.edu/) [School of Information](http://www.si.umich.edu/). My undergraduate work was in <a title="U of M EECS" href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/">electrical engineering</a> (signal processing and communications systems), also at the University of Michigan. My dissertation, then, is the perfect culmination of growing up in my dad's recording studio, then studying electrical engineering and HCI.

When I'm not [doing a science](https://twitter.com/SarcasticRover), I’m a sax player, I pretend to play guitar and bass, I practice yoga less frequently than I should, I recently retired from Northwestern’s [grad student a cappella group](http://sites.northwestern.edu/nutones/), I enjoy doing live audio, and I can usually be seen interacting with one or more Apple products.
