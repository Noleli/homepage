Hi, I'm Noah.

![Me]({{site.baseurl}}/images/me_fordshoot.png){: .alignright}I’m a fourth-year Ph.D. student in [Northwestern University](http://www.northwestern.edu)’s unique [Technology and Social Behavior](http://tsb.northwestern.edu/) program, a joint Ph.D. in [Computer Science](http://eecs.northwestern.edu/) and [Communication Studies](http://www.communication.northwestern.edu/). I am a member of the [CollabLab](http://collablab.northwestern.edu/), and work with the [Social Media Lab](http://socialmedia.northwestern.edu/), as well.

My interests range from traditional Human--Computer Interaction --- that is, creating usable, enjoyable interfaces through research and design --- to ubiquitous, pervasive, and urban computing, to the sociological impacts of technologically-mediated communication in all its forms. These include how social norms emerge in mediated contexts as well as how those new normative behaviors affect offline behavior in social contexts. Additionally, I am interested in the impact being an open-source software project has on design and usability.

Current projects include studying emoticon use and the use of haptic interfaces in communication.

I hope my work will shed light on how networked/&#8203;pervasive/&#8203;public/&#8203;personal/&#8203;mobile computing and communication impacts behavior within and outside those systems, both individually and collectively.

I have a Master’s in [HCI](http://www.si.umich.edu/academics/msi/human-computer-interaction-hci) from the [University of Michigan](http://www.umich.edu/) [School of Information](http://www.si.umich.edu/). My undergraduate work was in <a title="U of M EECS" href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/">electrical engineering</a> (signal processing and communications systems), also at the University of Michigan. The transition from the purely technical, through technology at the individual level (traditional HCI), to technology at the cultural and societal levels was unexpected, but awesome.

Outside of the lab, I’m a [sax player](http://mmb.music.umich.edu/), I practice yoga less frequently than I should, I sing in Northwestern’s [grad student a cappella group](http://groups.northwestern.edu/catatonics/), I enjoy doing live audio, and I can usually be seen interacting with one or more Apple products.
